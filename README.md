# Vim Config (Neovim)

This repo has laid fallow for the last 5 years. I am going to rededicate it to be a place to develop my nvim configuration as I am slowly starting to research and use Neovim. This will be a bit rough in the early going, but I plan to refine it as I go along. 

## Plugins Under Consideration

First and foremost, I am using nvim-lua's Kickstarter as a jumping off point:
https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

I also am interested in adopting a large number of the plugins from `dmmulroy`:

As well, I am also interested in `noice UI` and autocomplete in the command prompt:

Beyond that, I would like to try out LazyGit and Leap
